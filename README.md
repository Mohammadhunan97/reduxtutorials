# reduxtutorials
code I created based off the getting started with redux series from the official documentation


## PRINCIPLES OF REDUX: 
	1. ONE SINGULAR STATE: Everything is contained in one single state object (state tree).
	2. STATE IS READ ONLY: You can't write to the state tree, you must dispatch an action to make an adjustment (like a public object in java).
	3. STATE CAN BE CHANGED ONLY BY "PURE" FUNCTIONS KNOWN AS REDUCTERS: these functions describe events which can change state, you can later dispatch events.
