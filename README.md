# reduxtutorials
code I created based off the getting started with redux series from the official documentation


## PRINCIPLES OF REDUX: 
	1. Everything is contained in one single state object (state tree).
	2. You can't write to the state tree, you must dispatch an action to make an adjustment (like a public object in java).
